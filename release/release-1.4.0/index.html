To get the name of the generated gateway object, run kubectl get gateway -n &lt;namespace&gt; --template &#39;{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{&#34;\n&#34;}}{{end}}&#39;.

To get the name of the generated gateway object, run <code>kubectl get gateway -n &lt;namespace&gt; --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{&quot;\n&quot;}}{{end}}'</code>.  Next, run <code>kubectl get gateway &lt;gateway-name&gt; -n &lt;namespace&gt; -o yaml</code>
and review the <code>hosts</code> entry of the <code>.spec.servers</code> section to find the DNS name that corresponds to the
<code>gateway-hostname</code> to use in the URL.</li>
