	"content": "Contents  Client Configuration  Authentication with Managed Kubernetes Clusters Verify Connectivity    Client Configuration Client Configuration helps you get the necessary connectivity to your Kubernetes cluster. Use the Kubernetes Cluster Type field to select the target Kubernetes cluster type to show instructions for configuring kubectl to successfully connect to the cluster.\n The Kubectl Executable to Use field tells the WKT UI application where to find the correct version of kubectl to use. By using the Kubernetes Client Config File(s) field, you can specify a different Kubernetes client configuration file instead of, or in addition to, the default .kube/config file from your home directory. For environments where the client is configured to connect to multiple clusters, use the Kubernetes Config Context to Use field to specify the configuration file\u0026rsquo;s context associated with the cluster to which you want to connect. The Helm Executable to Use field tells the application where to find Helm, which is used to install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator and ingress controllers. For more information about Helm, see the Helm documentation.  Authentication with Managed Kubernetes Clusters Most cloud vendors require the use of their command-line tooling to authenticate kubectl connections to their managed Kubernetes clusters. For example, after kubectl is configured to connect to a Kubernetes cluster managed by the Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE), the Kubernetes client configuration file will have a section that looks similar to the one shown here.\nusers: - name: user-abcdefghi8d user: exec: apiVersion: client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1 command: oci args: - ce - cluster - generate-token - --cluster-id - ocid1.cluster.oc1.phx.aaaaaaaaahdirjdmcjfpogfkdhjsdhshssk2abcdefghijk2d - --region - us-phoenix-1 env: [] This configuration causes each kubectl invocation that references this user definition to execute the oci command (the Oracle Cloud command-line tool) to get the credentials necessary to successfully authenticate to the cluster. If the oci executable is not in a directory in the PATH environment variable when the kubectl command is executed, then an error similar to the one shown here will occur.\nFailed to verify Kubernetes client connectivity: Unable to verify Kubernetes client connectivity: Command failed: /Users/rpatrick/bin/kubectl version --short Unable to connect to the server: getting credentials: exec: executable oci not found It looks like you are trying to use a client-go credential plugin that is not installed. To learn more about this feature, consult the documentation available at: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#client-go-credential-plugins. When running the application on Windows or Linux, add the appropriate directory to the PATH environment variable and make sure to run the application with that environment. On MacOS, things are a bit more complicated.\nWhen running the WKT UI application on MacOS, the application inherits the environment of a daemon process called launchd instead of your environment. By default, the launchd environment contains only a few core directories on the PATH (that is, /usr/bin, /bin, /usr/sbin, and /sbin). This will cause kubectl invocations requiring access to one of the cloud providers' command-line tooling to fail if the tool is not found in one of those locations. While it is possible for an administrative user to change the environment that launchd uses to address this issue, the application provides the Extra Kubernetes Client Path Directories field to explicitly add the directory where the cloud providers' command-line tooling is installed, to the PATH that the application uses to invoke kubectl. Note that this field is only visible when running the application on MacOS.\nVerify Connectivity To verify the application configuration for connecting to the specified Kubernetes cluster, use the Verify Connectivity button on the Client Configuration page or Go \u0026gt; Verify Kubernetes Client Connection.\n"

	"content": "WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit UI has a number of prerequisites that must be installed locally to fully use the WKT UI application functionality.\nThese include:\n Java Development Kit (JDK) - Required by both WebLogic Deploy Tooling and WebLogic Image Tool. Install a JDK version that is compatible with your local WebLogic Server installation. WebLogic Server (WLS) - Required by WebLogic Deploy Tooling. Install a WebLogic Server version 12.2.1.3.0 or later; it is a best practice to install the latest Patch Set Updates (PSUs) and other recommended patches. The application uses WebLogic Server to gain access to the WebLogic Server Scripting Tool (WLST) and other related artifacts to use as a client. docker (or podman) - Required to create images locally and interact with image registries. kubectl - Required to interact with your Kubernetes cluster. Install a version that is compatible with your Kubernetes cluster version. For more information, see the Kubernetes Client Configuration page in the UI. Cloud Provider\u0026rsquo;s Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool - If your Kubernetes cluster is running in one of the cloud provider\u0026rsquo;s managed Kubernetes services, then you will need to download and install the cloud provider\u0026rsquo;s CLI. This is typically required to configure kubectl to properly authenticate to the Kubernetes cluster. Again, see the Kubernetes Client Configuration page for more information about configuring kubectl to work with your cluster. helm - Required to install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator and to install an ingress controller. openssl - Used to generate an X.509 TLS certificate for ingress routes, should you ask the application to generate one for you.  In addition to these local software dependencies, you will need a Kubernetes cluster to which you can deploy your containerized WebLogic Server domain and its applications. If you do not already have a model, then you can either write one by hand using the WKT UI application or discover the model from an existing domain. Most likely, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to start with a WebLogic domain that can be used to discover the model from the domain.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "The first stop for every new project is Project Settings. In this section, you make decisions and provide input for the project on:\n Credential Storage Domain Location Kubernetes Environment Target Type JDK and WebLogic Server Installation Directories Image Build Tool Type and Executable Location  Choosing a Credential Storage Scheme The WKT UI application can securely store credentials for your project or not store them at all. The three choices are to:\n Use the Native OS Credential Store Store Encrypted Credentials in the WKT Project File Not Store Credentials  If you choose Store in Native OS Credential Store, then you will be using the Windows Credential Manager, the MacOS Keychain, or the Linux libsecret library\u0026rsquo;s credential store. These credential stores offer a well-known, secure mechanism for storing credentials that most users already understand. The only downside to this scheme is that the credentials are stored only on the local machine. Anyone trying to share their project with others users will have to have the other users re-enter the credentials so that they get saved to their local machine\u0026rsquo;s credential store.\nThe WKT UI application can require storing a dozen or more credentials, depending on your WebLogic Server domain configuration. Upon first access by the WKT UI to load credentials from the credential store, the OS will prompt whether you want to allow the application access to each credential, prompting you once for each credential. This can get annoying, but on some platforms (for example, MacOS), you have the option of telling the OS to always allow access to the credential by the WKT UI application.\n The other choice to store credentials, Store Encrypted in Project File, uses a passphrase-based encryption built into the application that allows the credentials to be stored inline in the WKT Project file. The algorithms and techniques used follow the current industry standards and recommendations; however, because this project is open source, you can look at the details, if you are interested. The only downside to this approach is that, because the passphrase itself is never stored, you must share the passphrase with any other users that should be able to use the WKT Project file.\nA creative person might realize that they can use the passphrase-based encryption to move credentials normally stored in the native OS credential store to another machine. The steps to accomplish this would be:\n Open the project using the native OS credential store on the machine where the credentials are stored. Change the credential storage option to passphrase-based encryption and enter a passphrase. Save the project file. Open the project file on a different machine, supplying the passphrase entered in step 2. Change the credential storage option to native OS credential store. Save the project file.  The final choice, Not Stored, is to not store the credentials at all. While this is a viable option, it also means that whenever you need to run any of the actions that require credentials, you will need to re-enter the value of every credential in the project.\nChoosing a Domain Location When getting started with a new WKT Project, one of the first things to consider is where you want the domain to reside. Domains can reside in a container, in an image, or in a persistent volume. Your choice will expose and hide different fields across most sections of the UI. The following describe the implications of the three locations.\nCreated in the container from the model in the image - The newest and most popular location for a domain is in the container. This is known as \u0026ldquo;Model in Image\u0026rdquo; but also referred to as a \u0026ldquo;From Model\u0026rdquo; in the underlying WKT tooling. In this case, the set of model-related files are added to the image. When the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator domain object is deployed, its inspector process runs and creates the WebLogic Server domain inside a running container on-the-fly. While this process adds a small amount of overhead at startup, it also makes it easier to maintain the image. For example, you can have a common WebLogic Server image that is updated periodically to pick up the latest Patch Set Updates (PSUs). Then, you use that image to add the most recent version of the WebLogic Deploy Tooling and your domain model files as a layer on top.\nCreated as part of the image - This selection stores the domain in the image. This is known as \u0026ldquo;Domain in Image\u0026rdquo; but also is referred to as \u0026ldquo;Image\u0026rdquo; in the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator configuration. Using this option, the domain is created from the model by the WebLogic Image Tool (using the WebLogic Deploy Tooling) and baked into the image. While this saves a little overhead at startup, it is more expensive to maintain due to the need to recreate the domain every time a new WebLogic Server image is created.\nExternally created in a Kubernetes persistent volume - This selection stores the domain in a Kubernetes persistent volume; this is known as \u0026ldquo;Domain in PV\u0026rdquo;. This closely approximates the traditional way of maintaining a domain where the domain is created on disk and then used and maintained for as long as necessary. Depending on which Fusion Middleware products you are using, this may be your only supported choice for running the domain in Kubernetes. The WKT UI application currently doesn\u0026rsquo;t do anything to help you create the persistent volume, the necessary persistent volume claim, or the domain. After those things exist, the application will allow you to use them to deploy new domains stored in a persistent volume.\nChoosing a Kubernetes Environment Target Type The target type tells the application what sort of Kubernetes environment that you plan to use. Currently, WebLogic Kubernetes Operator and Verrazzano are the only two choices. The application uses the target type to:\n Tell WDT how to prepare the model for deployment. Determine what sections and their associated actions within the application, to display.  For example, the Kubernetes pages are relevant to the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator target type, so those pages and their associated actions are hidden when the Verrazzano target type is selected; instead, the Verrazzano pages are displayed. Note that in the current release, Verrazzano support is limited to the Model and Image sections.\nChoosing the Java and Oracle Installation Directories The application uses these directories when invoking the WebLogic Deploy Tooling and WebLogic Image Tool; it does not use them for any other purpose. When selecting these directories, make sure to select the same directory you would use to set the JAVA_HOME and ORACLE_HOME (or MW_HOME) environment variables. These are generally the top-level installation directories.\nChoosing the Image Build Tool To build new images, inspect images, and interact with image repositories, the WKT UI application uses an image build tool, which defaults to docker. The image build tool must be installed locally, as mentioned in the Prerequisites. While docker is currently the most popular tool, many vendors (for example, Oracle, IBM RedHat, Google) are moving to use podman by default.\n"

	"content": "Contents  WKT Project File Settings Outside the WKT Project File  Environment Variables User Preferences  Proxy Configuration Logging Configuration WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit UI Introduction Configuration   External Applications Bundled WKT Applications    Before giving you the whirlwind tour of the WKT UI application, it is important to know that the application is a native, desktop application. It uses native operating system features, such as:\n Native menus - Some of the application\u0026rsquo;s functionality is available only by using the menus. Registering file extensions - The application installer registers the .wktproj extension and associates itself with that extension. For example, this lets you double-click on the file in the native file browser and have the application start and open the selected project. Recent files integration - As you work with .wktproj files, the application adds those files to the OS-maintained list of recently used files. This causes these files to show up in OS-specific locations to provide shortcuts for opening the file with the application. For example, on MacOS, right-clicking on the application icon in the dock will display the recently used .wktproj files and selecting one will open an application window and load the contents of the .wktproj file.  WKT Project File What is a .wktproj file? Simply put, it is the application\u0026rsquo;s equivalent of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) project file. It stores:\n Metadata about the UI project. Pointers to WDT model-related files used by the project. Form field data that you enter into the application.  There are two ways to create a new project:\n Explicitly - Use File \u0026gt; New Project and select the file location and name. Implicitly - Use the application to start working. After you trigger an action that needs a project file, you are prompted to select the file location and name.  Note that the file extension for project files must be .wktproj. Otherwise, the application will not recognize the file as a project and will not allow it to be opened as a project file.\nThe WKT UI application uses a one project per window paradigm and most everything you do in the window is affected by the project data, either stored directly in the project file or in the WDT model-related files referenced by the project. However, there are a few exceptions that are covered in Settings Outside the WKT Project File.\nSettings Outside the WKT Project File Multiple factors influence the behavior of the WKT UI application in a particular environment. Other than the WKT Project file, those include:\n Environment Variables - The application uses the environment it inherits when it is started. User Preferences - The application\u0026rsquo;s user preferences file stores shared, user-level settings that transcend project boundaries. External Applications - The application or its components depend on an application being available and properly configured. Bundled WKT Applications - The application bundles its own copies of WebLogic Deploy Tooling and WebLogic Image Tool.  Environment Variables Some of the application\u0026rsquo;s behavior is influenced by environment variables it inherits when it is started. Environment variables affect the behavior of the WKT UI application when computing default values for application form fields. Some examples are:\n PATH - Used to locate executables like docker, helm, and kubectl. JAVA_HOME - Used as one way to find the directory where the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed. ORACLE_HOME and MW_HOME - Used to find the Oracle Fusion Middleware installation directory.  On Windows and Linux platforms, this tends to be the user\u0026rsquo;s environment that they have configured to be used when they log in. On MacOS, native applications do not inherit the user\u0026rsquo;s login environment. Instead, the application inherits the environment configured by the launchd daemon process. If you are running on MacOS, then you should keep this in mind when the application doesn\u0026rsquo;t behave as you expect.\n User Preferences The Preferences menu lets you configure settings that affect the behavior of the WKT UI application for the user across all instances of the application on the machine. These user-visible settings include the following categories:\n Proxy Configuration Logging Configuration WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit UI Introduction Configuration  Settings are also used to store internally used values that impact the appearance of the application. For example, the Window size is stored so that the application will open the window with your last known window size. The list of such appearance-related settings will likely grow over time.\nProxy Configuration If the WKT UI application is to be run from an environment where a proxy server is required to access the Internet, then you must configure the proxy server settings to allow Internet access. Currently, the UI depends on access to github.com to access release information and download new releases of the WKT tools and the UI itself. This connectivity is used in various places to determine default values for input data (for example, the default image tag to use for installing the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator) and providing updated features for the WKT tools bundled with the application, as well as updating the WKT UI application itself when a new release becomes available. Depending on the project configuration, the application may also require access to other sites, such as Docker Hub and other container registries, Helm chart download sites, and cloud-provider sites for authenticating to and accessing remote Kubernetes clusters.\nTo configure the proxy environment, use the Preferences menu to add or update the following fields, as needed:\n HTTPS Proxy URL - The full URL to the proxy server (for example, http://my-proxy-server.mycompany.com:80). Bypass Proxy Hosts - The comma-separated list of DNS or IP patterns that should not go through the proxy. For example, a value of .us.mycompany.com,.emea.mycompany.com,.apac.mycompany.com will skip the proxy for any DNS name that ends in one of the three domain names.  Logging Configuration Using this section, you can configure the logging output level and control the log file directory. The defaults are:\n File Transport Log Level - The logging level below which log messages will be discarded. For example, Debug messages will be discarded if the level is set to Info. The default value is Info. Log File Directory - The directory to which log files are written. The default is the user\u0026rsquo;s temporary directory, as defined by the operating system.  WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit UI Introduction Configuration This setting lets you turn on or off the in-application introductory information being displayed at startup. Show Introduction is always accessible from the Help menu.\nExternal Applications The WKT UI application depends on several external applications for its functionality. As such, it is important to install and configure these external applications properly on the local machine on which the application is running.\n docker (or podman) - Used to create new images and inspect the contents of custom base images. The WebLogic Image Tool depends on docker (or podman) for this functionality. docker (or podman) is also used to log in to and interact with image registries. kubectl - Used to get, create, and update configuration objects in your Kubernetes cluster. It is critical that the kubectl configuration file is properly set up to allow kubectl to authenticate to the cluster. helm - Used to install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator and ingress controllers. openssl - Used to generate X.509 TLS certificates, should you ask the application to generate one for your ingress route(s), only if you ask the application to generate it for you.  Bundled WKT Applications WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) and WebLogic Image Tool (WIT) are bundled with the WKT UI application. These tools are:\n WDT - Used to support discovering a model from an existing domain, prepare the model for a particular Kubernetes target type, and is used by the WebLogic Image Tool when creating the domain inside the image. WIT - Used to create a new image for your WebLogic Server domain. It is also used to inspect any custom base image that you might specify be used for creating the new image.  Use Help \u0026gt; Check For Updates periodically to make sure you are using the latest versions of these bundled tools.\n"

	"content": "Contents  Model Design View Code View  Model Editor Variables Editor Archive Editor   Prepare Model  Model The Model section helps you work with WebLogic Deploy Tooling models for a WebLogic domain. A WebLogic Deploy Tooling model for a domain can include the following file types:\n Model file - A declarative definition of the domain configuration. Variable file - A property file that maps names to values. These names can be referenced from the model file to allow a model to be used across environments by applying the variable file for a particular environment to the model. Archive file - A ZIP file containing application binaries and other files and directories needed to run the domain.  For more information about WebLogic Deploy Tooling models, see Metadata Model and Archive File in the WebLogic Deploy Tooling documentation.\nDesign View In the current release, the Design View is empty. Our intention is to eventually provide a WebLogic console-like set of pages that will make it easier to create or edit a model using an interface more familiar to WebLogic administrators and developers.\nCode View Using an IDE-like layout, the Code View provides editor panes for editing the model, variables, and archive files, each of which support creating and editing the domain\u0026rsquo;s WDT files. When working with an editor, there are several things to keep in mind:\n When working with a WKT Project that has no associated WDT file for storing the data, entering data into an editor will cause a new WDT file with the editor\u0026rsquo;s current content to be created and associated with the project. Changes made in the editor are buffered in memory until the WKT Project is saved. Adding, deleting, or modifying data in the variable or archive editors will not change the model references. You will need to make sure that the model references are accurate and up to date.  While it is possible to use the WKT UI application to create the files from scratch, the File \u0026gt; Add Model menu supports adding existing files or using the WebLogic Deploy Tooling\u0026rsquo;s Discover Domain Tool to create a model of an existing domain.\nWhile WebLogic Deploy Tooling supports using multiple model, variables, or archive files to describe a single domain, the current release of WKT supports only one WDT model file, one WDT variables file, and one WDT archive file for describing the domain.\n Model Editor In Code View, the model editor is just to the right of the navigation pane. This editor displays the current model file associated with the WKT Project file. Typing model content into the editor will result in a new model file being added to the project the next time the project is saved.\nThe current release has the following limitations:\n Model files must be in YAML format. Model files must exist directly on the file system and not inside an archive, such as in a ZIP file; any model file inside an archive is ignored by the application.  Variables Editor The WDT variables editor is in the upper right pane of the Code View page. It supports editing any existing name-value pairs, as well as adding or removing name-value pairs.\nTo reference a variable from the model, you must set the value of the desired model file to a variable reference. For example, the model snippet shown here references a variable named httpPort.\ntopology: Name: tododomain ProductionModeEnabled: true Cluster: mycluster: DynamicServers: ServerNamePrefix: Server_ DynamicClusterSize: 10 ServerTemplate: mysrvtemplate ServerTemplate: mysrvtemplate: ListenPort: \u0026#39;@@PROP:httpPort@@\u0026#39; Cluster: mycluster When working with this model file, WebLogic Deploy Tooling expects the httpPort variable to be defined in the model\u0026rsquo;s variables file, as shown here:\nhttpPort = 7001 Archive Editor The WDT archive editor is in the lower right pane of the Code View page. It supports adding content to and removing content from the archive file. While updating content in the archive is not supported directly by the archive editor, the archive editor safely supports multiple operations on the same entry. As such, combining a remove operation followed by the corresponding add operation will effectively replace an entry.\nTo add content to the archive file, use the plus (+) button in the archive editor title bar and follow the prompts to choose the type of content to add and select the corresponding file or directory. For example, to add a WAR file called todo.war to the archive, do the following:\n On the archive editor title bar, click +. In the resulting dialog, choose Application File from the list and click OK. In the resulting file chooser dialog, select the todo.war file and click Select.  This will result in the file structure wlsdeploy/applications/todo.war being added to the archive editor pane. At this point, the application has not created or modified the archive file; it is simply storing the data it needs about the archive path to the added entry and the file path where the content is found. Saving the WKT Project will update the archive to reflect the buffered operations performed in the editor.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to add the application to the model and set its SourcePath attribute to the path in the archive where it can be found, as shown in the following model file snippet.\n appDeployments: Application: todo: SourcePath: wlsdeploy/applications/todo.war ModuleType: war Target: mycluster To remove content from the archive file, select the content to remove in the archive editor pane and click the minus (-) button in the archive editor title bar. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to remove any reference to this content from the model file.\nPrepare Model Prepare Model invokes the WDT Prepare Model Tool to modify the model to work in a Kubernetes cluster with WebLogic Kubernetes Operator or Verrazzano installed. This action is available by using the Prepare Model button on the Model and Kubernetes WebLogic Domain pages and by selecting Go \u0026gt; Prepare Model for Kubernetes. It is also possible to run Prepare Model during the Create Image action, though typically it is best to run Prepare Model explicitly, prior to moving to the Image section.\nPrepare Model does the following:\n Removes model sections and fields that are not compatible with the target environment. Replaces endpoint values with model tokens that reference variables. Replaces credential values with model tokens that reference either a field in a Kubernetes secret or a variable. Provides default values for fields displayed in the application\u0026rsquo;s variable, variable overrides, and secret editors. Extracts topology information to the application that it uses to generate the resource file used to deploy the domain.  For more information, see the WDT model tokens documentation.\nIn replacing credential values, Prepare Model must handle the replacement differently for the \u0026ldquo;Domain in Image\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Model in Image\u0026rdquo; domain locations.\nWith \u0026ldquo;Domain in Image\u0026rdquo;, the WebLogic Image Tool creates the domain while creating the image. As such, it has no knowledge of Kubernetes so the token replacement uses variable tokens so that domain creation has access to the actual credential values. You must ensure that all variables have valid values prior to running Create Image.\nFor \u0026ldquo;Model in Image\u0026rdquo;, the domain is created at runtime by the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator running in a Kubernetes cluster. As such, token replacement uses secret tokens for all credential fields. You must to be sure to provide values for all secret reference fields using the WebLogic Domain section\u0026rsquo;s Secrets pane so that the required secrets get populated correctly during domain deployment. For more information, see WebLogic Domain.\nThe application tries to preserve any values from the model and variable files that Prepare Model replaces with secret tokens. The current release is limited by the behavior of the underlying WDT Prepare Model Tool in that all passwords are not retained and must be re-entered in the appropriate location.\n "

	"content": "Contents  WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Design View  WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Image Image Pull Secret Kubernetes Namespace Selection Strategy WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Role Bindings External REST API Access Third Party Integrations Java Logging   Code View Install Operator  WebLogic Kubernetes Operator This section provides support for installing the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator (the \u0026ldquo;operator\u0026rdquo;) in the target Kubernetes cluster. For detailed information about the operator, see the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator documentation.\nDesign View The Design View helps you specify the necessary data needed to install the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator to manage WebLogic domains in one or more Kubernetes namespaces. To install the operator using the default settings, simply provide values for the following three fields:\n Kubernetes Namespace - The Kubernetes namespace to which to install the operator. Kubernetes Service Account - The Kubernetes service account for the operator to use when making Kubernetes API requests. Helm Release Name to Use for Operator Installation - The Helm release name to use to identify this installation.  The WKT UI application overrides a few default values in the operator Helm Chart. Read the details of the parameters descriptions in Kubernetes Namespace Selection Strategy. These panes and their fields are made visible by expanding the Advanced portion of the page.\n WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Image By default, the operator\u0026rsquo;s Image Tag to Use field is set to the image tag corresponding to the latest operator release version on the GitHub Container Registry. The Image Pull Policy field configures the operator deployment in Kubernetes to tell it when to pull the image from the specified registry:\n If Not Present (default) - Only pull the image if it is not already present on the Kubernetes node. Always - Pull the image every time the image is needed to start a container. Never - Never pull the image; this will result in an error if the image is not already present on the Kubernetes node.  Because the GitHub Container Registry does not require image pull authentication to pull the official WebLogic Kubernetes Operator image, Image Pull Requires Authentication is disabled by default. If a custom operator image is being used from a container image registry that requires pull authentication, then enable the option and complete the appropriate fields described in the Image Pull Secret pane that follows.\nImage Pull Secret This pane is hidden unless the Image Pull Requires Authentication from the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Image pane is enabled. To allow Kubernetes to pull the custom operator image requiring pull authentication, use the Kubernetes Image Pull Secret Name field to provide the name of the Kubernetes secret to use for the credentials. To have the application create this secret, disable Use Existing Secret and provide the values for the following fields:\n Image Pull Secret Email Address - The email address of the user. Image Pull Secret Username - The user name to use when authenticating to the container image registry. Image Pull Secret Password - The user\u0026rsquo;s password to use when authenticating to the container image registry.  The read-only Image Registry Address field is parsed from the Image Tag to Use field. If the Image Registry Address field is empty, then the application will assume that Docker Hub is the target container image registry to use when creating the pull secret.\nKubernetes Namespace Selection Strategy The operator needs to know which WebLogic domains in the Kubernetes cluster that it will manage. It does this at the Kubernetes namespace level, so any WebLogic domain in a Kubernetes namespace the operator is configured to manage, will be managed by the operator instance being installed. Use the Kubernetes Namespace Selection Strategy field to choose the desired namespace selection strategy from one of the supported values:\n Label Selector (default) - Any Kubernetes namespace with a specified label will be managed by this operator. List - Any Kubernetes namespace in the provided list will be managed by this operator. Regular Expression - Any Kubernetes namespace whose name matches the provided regular expression will be managed by this operator. Dedicated - Only the Kubernetes namespace where the operator is installed will be managed by this operator.  Note that the operator Helm chart default is List but the application overrides this to specify Label Selector as the default value.\nEach namespace selection strategy takes different input values; the form fields will change based on the strategy selected:\n When using the Label Selector strategy, the Kubernetes Namespace Label Selector field will appear with a default value that aligns with the Helm chart default value. The Regular Expression strategy uses the required Kubernetes Namespaces Regular Expression field to specify the regular expression to use for matching the Kubernetes namespaces that the operator should manage. Selecting the List strategy will cause the Kubernetes Namespaces to Manage field to appear with a list containing the default namespace; this aligns with the default value in the Helm chart.  Removing the default namespace is fine and will result in an empty list. Note that when deploying the domain with an operator using the List strategy, the application will automatically add the new domain\u0026rsquo;s Kubernetes namespace to the list specified list, if needed. As such, specifying an empty list will not prevent your WebLogic domain from being managed by the operator.   Dedicated is self-defining so no additional fields are necessary.  WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Role Bindings When installing the operator, the operator Helm chart default is to create a Kubernetes Role and a Kubernetes RoleBinding in each Kubernetes namespace being managed by the operator. By enabling Enable Cluster Role Binding, the operator installation will create a Kubernetes ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding that the operator will use for all managed namespaces. This ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding will be shared across all operator installations in the Kubernetes cluster (assuming that those installations also enable cluster role binding).\nUsing the default namespace-specific roles and role bindings, the administrator follows the Principle of Least Privilege to guarantee that the operator cannot perform any actions on other, non-managed namespaces. The implication of this configuration is that because the operator service account does not have permission to create roles and role bindings, any new namespace added for the operator to manage does not have the necessary role and role binding needed for the operator to manage the namespace. Rerunning the operator Helm chart with the operator configured to manage the new namespaces will cause the Helm chart to create the necessary Role and RoleBinding objects in each namespace, as needed.\nIf the operator is using the ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding, then the new namespaces will be automatically picked up by the operator when using either the Label Selector or Regular Expression namespace selection strategy without any need to rerun the operator Helm chart.\nAs previously mentioned, the WKT UI application automatically reruns the operator Helm chart when deploying new WebLogic domains to ensure that the new domain\u0026rsquo;s namespace is being managed by the operator.\nExternal REST API Access By default, the operator\u0026rsquo;s REST API is not exposed outside the Kubernetes cluster. To enable the REST API to be exposed, enable Expose REST API Externally, set the desired HTTPS port using the External REST API HTTPS Port field, and name of the Kubernetes TLS secret to use in the External REST API Identity Secret Name field. For more information, see the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Rest API documentation.\nThird Party Integrations To enable integration with the Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) stack, enable ELK Integration Enabled and provide values for the following fields.\n Logstash Image Tag to Use - The container image of logstash to use. Elasticsearch Host Name - The DNS name of IP address of the Elasticsearch server. Elasticsearch Port - The port number for the Elasticsearch server.  For more information, see Elastic Stack integration in the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator documentation.\nJava Logging This pane lets you override the operator\u0026rsquo;s Java logging configuration, which can be useful when debugging issues with the operator. Use the Logging Level field to customize the minimum log level written to the log file. The Log File Size Limit field sets the maximum size of a single operator log file while the Log File Count limits the maximum number of retained log files. For more information, see Operator Helm configuration values in the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator documentation.\nCode View The WebLogic Operator page\u0026rsquo;s Code View displays a shell script that you can use as a starting point for automating the operator installation process.\nIf it is not already selected, then use the Script Language drop-down menu to choose the desired scripting language. Note that the application is providing a working sample script to show how the process might be automated. Before using the script, review the script and make any changes necessary for your environment. One typical change that would be considered a best practice would be to change the script to accept either command-line arguments or externally set environment variables to specify any credentials required by the script to eliminate hard-coding the credentials in the script itself. This change is left as an exercise for you because different environments typically will have existing standards for securely handling such credentials.\nInstall Operator Push Image uses the specified Image Builder program to upload (that is, push) the newly-built image to the image registry specified by its image tag. You can access it by using the Install Operator button on the WebLogic Operator page or Go \u0026gt; Install WebLogic Kubernetes Operator.\nAt a high level, Push Image performs the following steps:\n Validates the input values necessary for running the action based on your selections. Saves the WKT Project, if needed. Creates the Kubernetes namespace for installing the operator, if needed. Creates the Kubernetes service account for the operator to use, if needed. Creates the operator image pull secret, if needed. Adds the latest operator Helm chart to the local Helm repository. Runs Helm to install the operator using the specified configuration.  "

This page is divided into several primary panes and a few advanced panes that include:\n Target Image Name and Registry Credentials Base Image to Use Installers for Building the Image Patch Oracle Home WebLogic Deploy Tooling Configuration Image Build Configuration  Target Image Name and Registry Credentials The most important field in this pane is the Image Tag field. This is the name to give to the newly created image, which must conform to the image naming standards. Because most Kubernetes environments will need to pull the image from a container image registry (for example, Docker Hub), the newly-created image typically will need to be pushed to the appropriate container image registry. Most registries will require authentication as a user with the necessary permissions to push images. As described in the image naming standards, the Image Tag field typically must include the DNS name of the container image registry prior to the first slash (/) character. Images not containing a container image registry DNS name are assumed to be using Docker Hub.\nAfter the Image Tag field is populated, the application detects the presence of any prepended DNS name and displays the value in the Image Registry Address field. This field is read-only so the only way to change the DNS name is to change the value of the Image Tag field. The Image Registry Push Username and Image Registry Push Password fields let you provide the user credentials needed to log in to the container image registry prior to pushing the newly-created image. If explicit authentication is not required, then disable the Specify Image Push Credentials option. If Specify Image Push Credentials is enabled, then any attempts to push the image will fail unless the Image Registry Push Username and Image Registry Push Password fields are specified.\nBase Image to Use By default, the WebLogic Image Tool uses an Oracle Linux base image when building the new image. To specify a different base image, enable Use Custom Base Image and provide the base image\u0026rsquo;s tag in the Custom Base Image to Use field. Any container image registry address found in the base image tag will be displayed in the read-only Base Image Registry Address field. If pulling the base image requires authentication, then enable Custom Base Image Pull Requires Login and provide the necessary credentials in the Custom Base Image Pull Username and Custom Base Image Pull Password fields.\nWhen using a custom base image, the application requires the image to be inspected using the WebLogic Image Tool\u0026rsquo;s Inspect Image command. To invoke this inspection, click Inspect Custom Base Image. This inspection tells the application if Java or the Oracle Fusion Middleware software is already installed in the image. If it finds either of these software packages installed, then fields in the Installers for Building the Image pane will disappear because they are unneeded.\nIn the current release, the Patch Oracle Home pane will disappear if the base image contains an Oracle Fusion Middleware installation. The rationale being that the act of patching a base image installation will bloat the size of the image. As such, it is better to either create the base image with the latest patches already installed or allow the WebLogic Image Tool\u0026rsquo;s multistage build to install and patch the Oracle Fusion Middleware installation while minimizing the resulting image size.\nInstallers for Building the Image This pane will contain form fields for up to three installers (depending on the base image being used); they are:\n JDK Installer Oracle Fusion Middleware Installer WebLogic Deploy Tooling Installer  When specifying the JDK Installer, it is important to remember that this installer will be used to install the JDK inside the Linux x64 image being created. Therefore, the Linux JDK Installer to Use field should always point to the Linux x64 compressed archive installer (for example, jdk-8u291-linux-x64.tar.gz). While the value of the JDK Version field is just a tag associated with the installer used to specify which version of the JDK installer that the WebLogic Image Tool should use, the best practice is to set the value to the real version number (for example, 8u291 or 1.8.0_291).\nThe Oracle Fusion Middleware Installer to Use field must point to an installer that includes a modern version of WebLogic Server (12.2.1.3 or later). Use the Oracle Fusion Middleware Installer Type field to tell the WebLogic Image Tool which installer you are providing. It is important to make sure the type and installer match because installers of different types require different fields to be specified during installation. As with the JDK Version field mentioned previously, the Oracle Fusion Middleware Version field is just a tag to associate with the installer but the best practice is to set the value to the actual Oracle Fusion Middleware version number (for example, 12.2.1.4.0).\nBy default, Download and Use Latest WebLogic Deploy Tooling Installer is enabled so that the application will automatically download and use the latest, generally-available release in the WebLogic Deploy Tooling GitHub repository. To specify a different installer, disable Download and Use Latest WebLogic Deploy Tooling Installer and fill out the WebLogic Deploy Tooling Installer to Use and WebLogic Deploy Tooling Version fields appropriately. As with the other installers' version number fields, the best practice it to use the actual WebLogic Deploy Tooling version number (for example, 1.9.17). Note that new WDT versions often contain bug fixes or enhancements required to work with the latest capabilities, many of which are exposed by this application. As such, using the latest version is strongly recommended.\nPatch Oracle Home Oracle strongly recommends patching all Oracle Fusion Middleware installations with the latest Patch Set Updates (PSUs) and other recommended patches to ensure that the latest security fixes are applied. This pane configures the WebLogic Image Tool to apply the specified patches to the Oracle Home during the image creation process. There are two mechanisms for specifying that patches should be applied:\n Radio buttons to specify what patch bundles should be applied. The list of patch numbers to apply.  The patch bundle radio buttons provide three choices:\n None - Applies no bundle patches. Apply Latest PSU Only - Applies the latest PSU patch but no other recommended patches. Apply All Recommended Patches - Applies all recommended patches, which always includes the latest PSU, in addition to other important fixes.  Use the Individual Patches to Apply field to specify individual patch numbers to apply. These patches will be applied after any patch bundles specified.\nThe WKT UI application requires that valid Oracle Support credentials be specified using the Oracle Support Username and Oracle Support Password fields. This allows the WebLogic Image Tool to automatically discover the latest PSU and recommended patches and download any patches specified as part of the image creation process.\nAs a last resort, if no valid Oracle Support credentials are available, the patching process can be skipped by disabling the Apply Patches option. To make sure your WebLogic-based applications are as secure as possible, this really should be a last resort.\nWebLogic Deploy Tooling Configuration This Advanced pane applies only to images using either the \u0026ldquo;Model in Image\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Domain in Image\u0026rdquo; domain locations.\nThe Domain Type field tells WebLogic Deploy Tooling what type of domain to create. Use the Domain Home Directory to change the location of the WebLogic domain directory inside the container. The Model Home Directory field specifies the directory where the WDT model files are stored in the image. Typically, there is no need to override these directory locations because the application defaults follow the recommended best practices.\nImage Build Configuration This Advanced pane supports altering the default behavior of the WebLogic Image Tool, as well as extending the image build process to include custom build steps that might be required by particular applications or environments.\nThe JDK/FMW Installation Owner and JDK/FMW Installation Group fields specify the Linux user and group that should own the JDK and Oracle Fusion Middleware installation directories. The default values are generally fine for most environments. Any images intended to run in an OpenShift environment, where the configured Security Context Constraints cause the containers to run as a random user in the root group, will require changing the JDK/FMW Installation Group field from its default value to root. For more information, see Managing security context constraints in the OpenShift documentation.\nIf the base image is expected to change without the image tag changing, then enable Always Pull Base Image. With this option enabled, the image build process will always pull a new version of the base image to ensure that the latest version is being used. Otherwise, the base image will be pulled only if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t already exist in the local machine\u0026rsquo;s image cache.\nThe Image Build Network Name field allows an image build to run when the build process needs access to another container, such as a database that might be running in a container that is needed while WDT is creating the domain. Because the current release doesn\u0026rsquo;t support creating JRF domains during the image build process (that is, for the \u0026ldquo;Domain in Image\u0026rdquo; domain location), it is unlikely that this field will be needed. However, it is surfaced for completeness.\nTo add custom steps to the image build process, enable Extend Image Build and provide the Dockerfile containing the additional commands in the Additional Build Commands File field. If the specified Dockerfile needs additional files to be present in the build context directory, then provide the list of those required files in the Additional Build Files field.\nCode View The Image page\u0026rsquo;s Code View displays a shell script that you can use as a starting point for automating the image creation process.\nIf it is not already selected, then use the Script Language drop-down menu to choose the desired scripting language. Note that the application is providing a working sample script simply to show how the process might be automated. Before using the script, review the script and make any changes necessary for your environment. One typical change that would be considered a best practice would be to change the script to accept either command-line arguments or externally set environment variables to specify any credentials required by the script to eliminate hard-coding the credentials in the script itself. This change is left as an exercise for you because different environments typically will have existing standards for securely handling such credentials.\nCreate Image Create Image invokes the WebLogic Image Tool to create a new container image for running a WebLogic domain in a Kubernetes environment. You can access this action using the Create Image button on the Image page or the Go menu.\nAt a high level, Create Image performs the following steps:\n Validates the input values necessary for running the action based on your selections. Saves the WKT Project, if needed. Adds the installers to the WIT cache on the local machine using the WebLogic Image Tool Cache command. Builds the image on the local machine using the WebLogic Image Tool Create command.  Push Image Push Image uses the specified Image Builder program to upload (that is, push) the newly-built image to the image registry specified by its image tag. You can access it by using the Push Image button on the Image page or Go \u0026gt; Push Image to Registry.\nAt a high level, Push Image performs the following steps:\n Validates the input values necessary for running the action based on your selections. This includes making sure that an image with the specified Image Tag value exists in the local machine\u0026rsquo;s image cache. Saves the WKT Project, if needed. Logs in to the container image registry, if specified. Pushes the image to the container image registry.  "

	"content": "Contents  WebLogic Domain Design View  Image to Use for the Domain Clusters Model Variables Overrides Secrets Runtime Encryption Secret WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Introspection Configuration Domain-Wide Server Settings   Code View Prepare Model Deploy Domain Get Domain Status  WebLogic Domain The WebLogic Domain section provides support for creating and deploying the Kubernetes custom resource for the WebLogic domain as defined by the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator. For more information, see Domain Resource in the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator documentation.\nDesign View The Design View helps you specify the necessary data needed to generate the Domain resource definition and deploy that resource into a Kubernetes cluster.\nThe Domain UID field defines the name of the Kubernetes Domain custom resource object. This name must be unique within the Kubernetes namespace where it will be created, which is controlled by the Kubernetes Namespace field.\nThe default value of the Domain UID field is based on the WebLogic domain\u0026rsquo;s name, as defined by the WDT model:\n When using either \u0026ldquo;Model in Image\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Domain in Image\u0026rdquo; domain location, the Domain Home Path field is read-only and its value is set using the Domain Home Directory field under Advanced. When using \u0026ldquo;Domain in PV\u0026rdquo;, this field must be set to the fully qualified path to the domain home directory in the persistent volume. For example, if the persistent volume mount path is set to /shared and the domain home is located in /domains/mydomain in the persistent volume, then the Domain Home Path field must be set to /shared/domains/mydomain.  Set the Kubernetes secret name where the WebLogic domain credentials will be stored using the WebLogic Credentials Secret Name field. Set the value of the WebLogic Server administration credentials using the WebLogic Admin Username and WebLogic Admin Password fields. Remember that these fields must be set appropriately for the selected domain location:\n For \u0026ldquo;Model in Image\u0026rdquo;, these fields are used to set the WebLogic Server credentials used to create the domain, and by the operator at runtime to perform actions on the domain (for example, start a server). For \u0026ldquo;Domain in Image\u0026rdquo;, the domain was created using the WebLogic Image Tool using the credentials specified in the model. These values must match the ones used during the image creation process. For \u0026ldquo;Domain in PV\u0026rdquo;, the domain was created outside the application so the values provided in these fields must match the ones used when the domain was created.  When using \u0026ldquo;Domain in PV\u0026rdquo;, three additional fields associated with the persistent volume will be shown:\n Persistent Volume Name - The name of the persistent volume to use in the Domain resource file. Persistent Volume Claim Name - The persistent volume claim to associate with the persistent volume. Persistent Volume Mount Path - The path to the persistent volume within the container(s). Enable Log Home - Enables the ability to separate the logs directory from the domain directory on the persistent volume. Log Home Path - The path to use for the log home when Enable Log Home is enabled.  The following sections describe the other panes that support configuring the generated Domain resource; they are:\n Image to Use for the Domain Clusters Model Variables Overrides Secrets Runtime Encryption Secret WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Introspection Configuration Domain-Wide Server Settings  Image to Use for the Domain This pane focuses on the container image to use to run the WebLogic Server domain in a container.\n When using either \u0026ldquo;Model in Image\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Domain in Image\u0026rdquo; domain location, the Image Tag field is read-only; its value is set using the Image Tag field in the Image section. In the case of \u0026ldquo;Domain in PV\u0026rdquo;, the Image Tag field is not read-only and is the place to specify the image to use to run the WebLogic domain\u0026rsquo;s containers. The read-only Image Registry Address field is populated by parsing the value of the Image Tag field to extract any container image registry address. If the tag has no image registry address, then it is assumed to reside on Docker Hub.  Use the Image Pull Policy field to specify when Kubernetes should pull the image from the specified image registry. The choices are:\n If Not Present (default) - Only pull the image if it is not already present on the Kubernetes node. Always - Pull the image every time the image is needed to start a container. Never - Never pull the image; this will result in an error if the image is not already present on the Kubernetes node.  If pulling the image from the specified image registry does not require authentication, then Specify Image Pull Credentials should be disabled. When enabled, use the Use Existing Image Pull Secret field to tell the application whether to use an existing image pull secret or create a new one. Specify the image pull secret name in the Image Pull Secret Name field. When creating a new secret, specify the secret data using the Image Registry Pull Username, Image Registry Pull Email Address, and Image Registry Pull Password fields.\nClusters The Clusters pane lists the names of each cluster in the model and lets you adjust the WebLogic Server startup configuration and Kubernetes resource requests and limits. It is currently populated when Prepare Model is run, which means that projects using \u0026ldquo;Domain in PV\u0026rdquo; will not have access to adjust the configuration at the cluster level. \u0026ldquo;Domain in PV\u0026rdquo; projects can still use the Domain-Wide Server Settings pane under Advanced.\nTo view or edit the settings for a cluster, select the edit icon at the right end of the cluster\u0026rsquo;s row in the table. This opens a dialog that shows all the cluster-related fields and their values. The read-only Cluster Name field shows the name of the cluster, as specified in the underlying model.\nUse the Replicas field to adjust the number of managed servers that the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator should start when the domain is deployed. The default value for the Replicas field is set based on the maximum number of servers specified by the model:\n In the case of a static cluster, it will be the number of servers that are configured to be part of the cluster. When using a dynamic cluster, the value is set based on the maximum number of servers that the dynamic cluster allows. This default value also serves as the upper limit for the Replicas field. In other words, you may only reduce the number of replicas. It is not possible to increase the replica count above the maximum limit defined by the model.  Use the Minimum Heap Size and Maximum Heap Size fields to control the amount of Java heap space available for each server in the cluster. Specify any additional Java command-line options with the Additional Java Options field.\nDisable debug logging to standard out disables WebLogic Server debug log messages from being written to standard out. In WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3.0, there is an issue that impacts the Oracle JDBC driver processing FAN (Fast Application Notification) events from an Oracle Database. To work around this issue, enable Disable Oracle JDBC Support for FAN Events.\nUse pseudo-random number generator controls whether WebLogic Server uses the pseudo-random number generator (that is, /dev/urandom) or the regular random number generator (that is, /dev/random). Because the latter is impacted by the available entropy, it can negatively impact performance when running WebLogic Server on a virtual machine or in a container. Because the servers being configured by this application will always be running in a container, the default is set to use the pseudo-random number generator.\nThe Kubernetes resource requests and limits values help the Kubernetes scheduler determine which node to use to start a container (to ensure there are sufficient resources available for the container to run). The following fields allow these values to be specified:\n Kubernetes CPU Request - The requested amount of CPU for each managed server\u0026rsquo;s container. Kubernetes CPU Limit - The maximum amount of CPU each managed server\u0026rsquo;s container is allowed to use. Kubernetes Memory Request - The requested amount of memory for each managed server\u0026rsquo;s container. Kubernetes Memory Limit - The maximum amount of memory each managed server\u0026rsquo;s container is allowed to use.  For more information about these fields and setting their values, see the Kubernetes documentation.\nModel Variables Overrides Use this pane to override values of model variables when using \u0026ldquo;Model in Image\u0026rdquo; to customize the model data already set in the image. For example, the image may contain a variable whose value refers to a JDBC URL to connect to a database. Because the image may be used across development, test, and production environments, overriding the JDBC URL to point to the correct database for the environment helps make the same image usable across all three environments. All override values are added to a Kubernetes ConfigMap that is passed to the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator so that it creates the underlying WebLogic Server domain with the correct values for the environment.\nIf the model has one or more variables, then the Kubernetes Config Map Name field is visible and allows the name of the Kubernetes ConfigMap name to be controlled. The table will be populated with the model variables, as defined by the model variables file. Because the model variables file is typically already set in the image by the time you reach this page, both the Model Variable Name and the Model Variable File Value entries are read-only. Enter an Model Variable Override Value for any variable whose Model Variable File Value should be overridden. Note that the ConfigMap will only be created if one or more variables have an override value specified.\nSecrets When using \u0026ldquo;Model in Image\u0026rdquo;, use this pane to set the value of any secrets referenced in the model (other than the WebLogic administrator credentials secret). The secrets that appear in the table are pulled from the model file directly; as such, the Secret Name field is read-only. Set the appropriate Username and Password field values for each secret in the table. These values are required and will be used to create or update the secret with the specified values.\nRuntime Encryption Secret When using \u0026ldquo;Model in Image\u0026rdquo;, the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator requires a runtime encryption secret it uses to encrypt sensitive WebLogic Server domain data stored in Kubernetes. For more information, see Required runtime encryption secret in the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator documentation.\nUse the Runtime Encryption Secret Name field to control the name of the secret, if needed. Typically, the default name is sufficient. The Runtime Encryption Secret Value field\u0026rsquo;s default value is generated but may be changed, if desired.\nWebLogic Kubernetes Operator Introspection Configuration This pane controls the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator introspection job configuration. Use the Introspection Job Active Deadline Seconds field to control how long the operator waits for the introspection job to complete. The application sets the default to 900 seconds (15 minutes); this overrides the underlying default of 120 seconds (2 minutes) built into the operator. As such, clearing the value of this field will cause the effective value to be set to 120 seconds.\nDomain-Wide Server Settings This pane lets you adjust the WebLogic Server startup configuration and Kubernetes resource requests and limits default values for every WebLogic Server container in the WebLogic Server domain. Any fields set here will be applied only if they are not overridden elsewhere. For example, setting the Minimum Heap Size will set WebLogic Server\u0026rsquo;s minimum heap size to the specified value only if the cluster to which the server belongs does not override the minimum heap size. For typical domains with an Administration Server and one or more clusters, the best practice is to use this section to configure the Administration Server and use the Clusters pane to configure each cluster explicitly.\nThe fields in this pane have similar meaning to the equivalent fields previously described in Clusters; refer to that section for more information.\nCode View The Code View displays a shell script for deploying the domain and creating its dependent resources as well as the YAML definition for the Kubernetes custom resource (that is, the Domain resource) and the Model Variables Overrides ConfigMap, if applicable.\nIf it is not already selected, then use the Script Language drop-down menu to choose the desired scripting language. Note that the application is providing a working sample script simply to show how the process might be automated. Before using the script, review the script and make any changes necessary for your environment. One typical change that would be considered a best practice would be to change the script to accept either command-line arguments or externally set environment variables to specify any credentials required by the script to eliminate hard-coding the credentials in the script itself. This change is left as an exercise for you because different environments typically will have existing standards for securely handling such credentials.\nPrepare Model Prepare Model is the same as was previously described in the Model section. It is only surfaced here because the Clusters pane of the Design View is populated only when Prepare Model is run.\nDeploy Domain Deploy Domain creates the Domain custom resource object and any of its dependent objects (for example, namespace, secrets, ConfigMap) in Kubernetes. You can access it by using the Deploy Domain button on the WebLogic Domain page or Go \u0026gt; Deploy WebLogic Domain to Kubernetes. As previously mentioned, this action also updates the operator configuration, if needed, and reruns the operator Helm chart to ensure that the new namespace is manageable by the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator configured for this project.\nDeploy Domain completes as soon as the objects are created and the operator Helm chart execution completes. At some point after the action completes, the operator will detect a new (or updated) version of the Domain custom resource object and start a new introspection job to create the domain and start or restart the WebLogic Server containers. Get Domain Status provides the current status of the last Deploy Domain action.\nGet Domain Status To view the current status of the last domain deployment, use the Get Domain Status button or the Go \u0026gt; Get WebLogic Domain Status. This action retrieves and displays the domain deployment status, as provided by the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator.\n"

First, it supports installing an ingress controller to a Kubernetes cluster. Second, it supports adding the necessary routes to an ingress controller to make a deployed WebLogic domain\u0026rsquo;s end-points accessible.\nDesign View Design View helps you specify the data needed to install an ingress controller, if desired, and specify the data needed to expose one or more endpoints for a deployed WebLogic domain. This page contains three panes:\n Ingress Controller Configuration TLS Secret for Ingress Routes Ingress Routes Configuration  Ingress Controller Configuration The most important field in this pane is the Ingress Provider field. This fields tells the WKT UI application with which of the supported ingress controllers it will need to work. The current release supports two ingress controllers:\n NGINX Traefik  To install the ingress controller, enable Install Ingress Controller.\n To set the release name used by the Helm install process, use the Helm Release Name to Use field. Set the Kubernetes namespace to which the ingress controller should be installed with the Ingress Controller Namespace field.  The container image for the Traefik ingress controller resides in Docker Hub. Due to changes made to Docker Hub, anonymous pull requests are throttled. This can result in pull requests being denied when the Kubernetes cluster attempts to pull the image and start the container.\n To work around this limitation, enable the Use Docker Hub Secret field to provide login credentials for Docker Hub. The Docker Registry Secret Name field specifies the name of the Kubernetes pull secret to use when pulling the image. To create this secret, enable Create Docker Hub Secret and fill in the pull secret data in the Docker Hub Username, Docker Hub Password, and Docker Hub Email Address fields.  TLS Secret for Ingress Routes Use this pane to configure the Transport Layer Security (TLS) secret containing the certificate and private key data that will be used by the ingress controller when establishing HTTPS connections from clients to the ingress controller. The TLS connection will be terminated at the ingress controller, so traffic between the ingress controller and services/pods will not be encrypted. In the current release, only a single TLS certificate is supported for the routes being defined.\n To use TLS-enabled routes, enable Use Ingress TLS Secret and provide the secret name using the Ingress TLS Secret Name field. To have the application create this secret, enable Create Ingress TLS Secret. If you already have a certificate file and its corresponding private key file, then use the TLS Certificate File and TLS Private Key File fields to provide them. To create these files automatically, enable Generate a TLS Certificate and Private Key.  Provide the path to the OpenSSL executable using the OpenSSL Executable to Use field. Use the Subject to Use for the Generated TLS Certificate field to specify the data to put into the subject of the certificate.  For example, if your ingress route will use the virtual host name www.myapp.com, you might specify the subject contents as /CN=www.myapp.com. The subject data will support multiple key/value pairs using a comma-separated syntax, like /key1=value1,/key2=value2,/key3=value3.      Ingress Routes Configuration Use the table in this section to define the ingress routes to be added by the application. Note that this table does not currently display existing routes already defined. Any routes defined in or removed from the table will happen in the WKT Project object. When applying or updating the routes, only the fields currently in the table will be considered. If the routes do not exist, then they will be added. If one or more of the routes already exists, then the application will warn you to confirm whether you want to update the existing route or routes before performing the operation.\nTo add a new route, click the plus (+) button in the table header. To edit a route, use the edit button on the corresponding route row. To remove a route, use the delete icon on the corresponding route row.\nWhen editing a route:\n Use the Name field to set the route name. Use the Virtual Host and Path Expression fields to define the matching rules that determine which requests match this route. All requests in the defined rules are routed to the service specified by the Target Service field that resides in the namespace specified by the read-only Target Service Namespace field and the port specified by the Target Port field. To enable TLS between the client and the ingress controller, enable the Enable TLS option. Remember, enabling TLS means that the TLS secret information must be provided in the TLS Secret for Ingress Routes pane. Different ingress controllers support advanced ingress route configuration using ingress controller-specific annotations. Use the Ingress Route Annotations table to add annotations to the ingress route, as needed.  Code View The Code View displays shell scripts for installing an ingress controller and for updating ingress routes. It also displays the YAML definitions of the routes to be added, if applicable.\nIf it is not already selected, then use the Script Language drop-down menu to choose the desired scripting language. Note that the application is providing a working sample script simply to show how the process might be automated. Before using the script, review the script and make any changes necessary for your environment. One typical change that would be considered a best practice would be to change the script to accept either command-line arguments or externally set environment variables to specify any credentials required by the script to eliminate hard-coding the credentials in the script itself. This change is left as an exercise for you because different environments typically will have existing standards for securely handling such credentials.\nInstall Ingress Controller Install Ingress Controller creates any namespace and secret specified and runs the ingress controller\u0026rsquo;s Helm chart to install the ingress controller. You can access it by using the Install Ingress Controller button on the Ingress Controller page or Go \u0026gt; Install Ingress Controller.\nUpdate Ingress Routes Update Ingress Routes creates the TLS secret, if needed, and adds or updates the specified ingress routes. You can access it by using the Update Ingress Routes button on the Ingress Controller page or Go \u0026gt; Update Ingress Routes to Domain.\n"

	"content": "WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit UI Documentation The WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit (WKT) is a collection of open source tools that help you provision WebLogic-based applications to run in Linux containers on a Kubernetes cluster. WKT includes the following tools:\n WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) - A set of single-purpose, lifecycle tools that operate off of a single metadata model representation of a WebLogic domain. WebLogic Image Tool (WIT) - A tool for creating Linux container images for running WebLogic domains. WebLogic Kubernetes Operator (WKO) - A Kubernetes operator that allows WebLogic domains to run natively in a Kubernetes cluster.  The WKT UI provides a graphical user interface that wraps the WKT tools, Docker, Helm, and the Kubernetes client (kubectl) and helps guide you through the process of creating and modifying a model of your WebLogic domain, creating a Linux container image to use to run the domain, and setting up and deploying the software and configuration necessary to deploy and access the domain in your Kubernetes cluster.\nCurrent release WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit UI version and release information can be found here.\nAbout the Documentation For detailed user information, read the following:\n About the WKT UI Application WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit UI Prerequisites and Installation Navigate the WKT UI  Model Image Kubernetes Verrazzano    For developer information, see WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit UI Project\nGet Help We have a closely monitored public Slack channel where you can get in touch with us to ask questions about using the WebLogic Toolkit UI or give us feedback or suggestions about what features and improvements you would like to see.
