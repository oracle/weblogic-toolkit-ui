# WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit UI
The WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit (WKT) is a collection of open source tools that help you provision WebLogic-based
applications to run in Linux containers on a Kubernetes cluster.  WKT includes the following tools:

- [WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT)](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling) - A set of single-purpose,
  lifecycle tools that operate off of a single metadata model representation of a WebLogic domain.
- [WebLogic Image Tool (WIT)](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool) - A tool for creating Linux container
  images for running WebLogic domains.
- [WebLogic Kubernetes Operator (WKO)](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator) - A Kubernetes operator
  that allows WebLogic domains to run natively in a Kubernetes cluster.

The WKT UI provides a graphical user interface that wraps the WKT tools, Docker, Helm, and the Kubernetes client
(`kubectl`) and helps guide you through the process of creating and modifying a model of your WebLogic domain, creating
a Linux container image to use to run the domain, and setting up and deploying the software and configuration
necessary to deploy and access the domain in your Kubernetes cluster.
