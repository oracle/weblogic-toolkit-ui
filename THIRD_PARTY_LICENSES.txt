CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
   Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
   to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
     and translate a Work;

  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
       depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
     a Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
       based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
   the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
   detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
   shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
   any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
   by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
   Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
   is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
   non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
   unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
   the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
   provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
   in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
   purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
   promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
   of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
   License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
   applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
   invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
   affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
   Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
   and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
   Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
     surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
     of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
     including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
     for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
     other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
     discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
     that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
     any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
     disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
     or other rights required for any use of the Work.

  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
     party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
     CC0 or use of the Work.

        the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
        Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
        NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
        License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
        Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE
        text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed as modifying the License.
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
        provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,

   writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
   Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
   ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
   warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
   determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and
   assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
   License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether
   in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
   applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed
   to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,
   including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
   damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of
   the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages

GNU General Public License v3.0 or later

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and
other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU
General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for
all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public
License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released
this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that
you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can
do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you
received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1)
assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that
there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors'
sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that
their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous
versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.
This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users'
freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs
in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it
is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to
prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise
substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to
those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom
of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special
danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to
render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.
   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
   works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
   License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
   "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in
   a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
   exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
   earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
   the Program.

   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
   permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement
   under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
   modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with
   or without modification), making available to the public, and in some
   countries other activities as well.

   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
   parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a
   computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
   extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that
   (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that
   there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties
   are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and
   how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of
   user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list
   meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a
   work.

   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
   standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
   interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
   widely used among developers working in that language.

   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than
   the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging
   a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b)
   serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to
   implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to
   the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context,
   means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of
   the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs,
   or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used
   to run it.

   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
   source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run
   the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those
   activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or
   general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
   unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the
   work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition
   files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for
   shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
   specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication
   or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
   regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
   copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
   conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
   permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
   covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
   content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights
   of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
   without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You
   may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them
   make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for
   running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this
   License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.
   Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so
   exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms
   that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material
   outside their relationship with you.

   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
   conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
   unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
   under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the
   WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws
   prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
   circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
   is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the
   covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
   modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
   users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
   technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
   receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
   keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive
   terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all
   notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of
   this License along with the Program.
   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and
   you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
   produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of
   section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
        and giving a relevant date.

     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
        under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
        requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all
        notices".

     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
        anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
        therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional
        terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how
        they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the
        work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if
        you have separately received it.

     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
        Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
        interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
        need not make them do so.

   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
   which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which
   are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a
   volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if
   the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the
   access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the
   individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does
   not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
   sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
   Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
   ways:

     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
        Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
        used for software interchange.

     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
        offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
        offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
        anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
        Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
        covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily
        used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
        reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source,
        or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server
        at no charge.

     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
        written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative
        is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
        received the object code with such an offer, in accord with
        subsection 6b.

     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
        (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
        Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
        further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
        Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
        copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
        may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that
        supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear
        directions next to the object code saying where to find the
        Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
        Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
        available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
        inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
        the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
        subsection 6d.
        A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
        from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
        included in conveying the object code work.

   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
   tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or
   household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
   into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
   doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular
   product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical
   or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the
   particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,
   or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer
   product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
   industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only
   significant mode of use of the product.

   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
   procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
   and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
   a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
   suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
   code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
   modification has been made.

   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
   specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part
   of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User
   Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term
   (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding
   Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation
   Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any
   third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the
   User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
   requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
   for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
   the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a
   network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
   adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
   protocols for communication across the network.

   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
   accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented
   (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form),
   and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or
   copying.

7. Additional Terms.

   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
   License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
   Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be
   treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that
   they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only
   to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those
   permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License
   without regard to the additional permissions.

   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove
   any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.
   (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in
   certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional
   permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you
   have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add
   to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
   material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms
        of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
        author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
        Notices displayed by works containing it; or

     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
        requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
        reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
        authors of the material; or

     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
        names, trademarks, or service marks; or

     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material
        by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
        contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
        liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those
        licensors and authors.

   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
   restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
   received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
   governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,
   you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further
   restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you
   may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license
   document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such
   relicensing or conveying.

   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
   place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms
   that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the
   applicable terms.

   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form
   of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above
   requirements apply either way.

8. Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
   provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
   modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
   this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
   paragraph of section 11).
   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
   from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless
   and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your
   license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you
   of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the
   cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
   permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
   reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
   violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and
   you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
   licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
   License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
   reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
   material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
   copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring
   solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a
   copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than
   this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered
   work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.
   Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
   acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives
   a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that
   work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing
   compliance by third parties with this License.
   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
   organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
   organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
   results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
   receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work
   the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
   paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the
   work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can
   get it with reasonable efforts.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
   granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a
   license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under
   this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim
   or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed
   by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or
   any portion of it.

11. Patents.

   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
   License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work
   thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
   controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
   acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this
   License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not
   include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
   modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,
   "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
   consistent with the requirements of this License.

   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
   patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,
   use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate
   the contents of its contributor version.

   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
   agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
   (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue
   for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party
   means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent
   against the party.

   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and
   the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy,
   free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly
   available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must
   either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2)
   arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this
   particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the
   requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
   recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but
   for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or
   your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one
   or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to
   believe are valid.

   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,
   you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and
   grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work
   authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of
   the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically
   extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the
   scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
   the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
   granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are
   a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of
   distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party
   based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under
   which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the
   covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection
   with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those
   copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or
   compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that
   arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
   implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
   available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
   covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
   not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
   to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
   the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
   License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission
   to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3
   of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and
   to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to
   apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements
   of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning
   interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.
   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
   License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of
   any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
   Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public
   License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
   Foundation.

   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of
   the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement
   of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that
   version for the Program.

   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
   However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
   holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
   APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
   HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
   OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
   THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
   IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
   ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
   ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
   PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
   GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
   USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
   DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
   PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
   EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
   SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
   cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
   courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
   waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a
   warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in
   return for a fee.

   the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic,
   verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its
   representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic
   mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems

   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
   reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly
   perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works
   in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this

   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated
   in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
   sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies
   only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are
   necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
   of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
   submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
   Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
   contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You
   under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
   litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
   Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications,
   and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
        copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating

        from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
        then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable
        copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
        Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a
        NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within
        the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
        Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
        NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
        License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
        Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE
        text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed as modifying the License.
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
        provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
        reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
   Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to
   the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,
   without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above,
   nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license
   agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
   trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
   required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
   Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
   writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
   Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
   ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
   warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for

   assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
   License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether
   in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
   applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed
   to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,
   including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
   damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of
   the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages
   for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
   any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work
   or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee
   for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
   obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
   accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
   Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and

   for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
   Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
   liability.

   behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
   reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly
   perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works
   in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated
   in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
   sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies
   only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are
   necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
   of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
   submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
   Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
   contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You
   under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
   litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
   Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications,
   and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
        copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
        that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
        distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
        from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
        then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable
        copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
        Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a
        NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within
        the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
        Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
        NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
        License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
        Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE
        text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed as modifying the License.
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
        provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
        reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
        Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
        distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
        in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
   Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to
   the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,

   agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
   trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
   required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
   Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
   writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
   Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
   ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
   warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
   determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and
   assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
   License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether
   in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
   applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed
   to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,
   including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
   damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of
   the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages
   for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
   any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work
   or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee
   for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
   obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
   accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
   Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and

   for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
   Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
   liability.

CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
   Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
   to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
     and translate a Work;

  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
       depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
     a Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
       based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
   the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
   detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
   shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
   any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
   by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
   Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
   is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
   non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
   unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
   the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
   provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
   in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
   purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
   promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
   of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
   License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
   applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
   invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
   affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
   Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
   and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
   Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
     surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
     of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
     including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
     for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
     other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
     discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
     that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
     any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
     disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
     or other rights required for any use of the Work.

  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
     party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
     CC0 or use of the Work.

   only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are
   necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
   of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
   submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
   Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
   contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You
   under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
   litigation is filed.

        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
        then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable
        copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
        Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a
        NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within
        the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
        Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
        NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
        License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
        Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE
        text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed as modifying the License.
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
        provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
        reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such

        distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
        in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
   Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to
   the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,
   without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above,
   nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license
   agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
   trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
   required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
   Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
   writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
   Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
   ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
   warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
   determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and
   assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
   License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether
   in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
   applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed
   to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,
   including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
   damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of
   the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages
   for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
   any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work
   or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee
   for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
   obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
   accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
   Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
   only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless
   for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
   Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
   liability.

Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their
terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons
disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by
those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways
otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of
the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all
rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject
to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used
under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for
licensors: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a
licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under
specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary
for any reason--for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation
to copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses
grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a
licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be
restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other
rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking
that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our
licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public
License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights
in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the
Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor
receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
     Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or
     otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright
     and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public
     License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or
     sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed
     Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and
     Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance
     with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance,
     broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without
     regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this
     Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not
     Copyright and Similar Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty
     adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
     exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to
     Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
     material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
     conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
     Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that
     the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under
     this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process
     that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction,
     public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination,
     communication, or importation, and to make material available to the
     public including in ways that members of the public may access the
     material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting
     from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of
     11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or
     succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the
     world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
     this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

  a. License grant.

     1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
        Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
        non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the
        Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

        A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
        B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

     2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
        Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does
        not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and
        conditions.

     3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

     4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
        authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and
        formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical
        modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees
        not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making
        technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,
        including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
        Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
        making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces
        Adapted Material.

     5. Downstream recipients.

        A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
           Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor
           to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of
           this Public License.
        B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
           additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any
           Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing
           so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of
           the Licensed Material.

     6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
        construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your
        use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
        endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
        designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

     1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under
        this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
        personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor
        waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the
        Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the
        Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

     2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

     3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
        royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
        directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or
        waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases
        the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

     1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form),
        You must:

        A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with
           the Licensed Material:
           i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and
              any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable
              manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
              designated);
           ii. a copyright notice;
           iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
           iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
           v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent
              reasonably practicable;
        B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an
           indication of any previous modifications; and
        C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public
           License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to,
           this Public License.

     2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable
        manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the
        Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
        conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes
        the required information.

     3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
        required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

     4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You
        apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from
        complying with this Public License.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
     extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
     contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
     database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database
     in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual
     contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
     substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
     possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and
     as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
     concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or
     other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title,
     merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,
     absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence
     of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of
     warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not
     apply to You.

  b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
     any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise
     for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,
     exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of
     this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor
     has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or
     damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in
     part, this limitation may not apply to You.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
     shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most
     closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
     Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
     License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
     automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

     1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
        cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

     2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right
     the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
     License.

  d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
     Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the
     Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this
     Public License.

  e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
     conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
     Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms
     and conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not
     be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any
     use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without
     permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
     unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
     necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it
     shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the
     enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
     to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
     limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply
     to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any
     jurisdiction or authority.

CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
   Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
   to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
     and translate a Work;

  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
       depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
     a Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
       based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
   the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
   detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
   shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
   any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
   by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
   Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
   is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
   non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
   unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
   the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
   provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
   in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
   purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
   promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
   of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
   License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
   applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
   invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
   affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
   Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
   and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
   Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
     surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
     of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
     including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
     for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
     other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
     discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
     that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
     any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
     disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
     or other rights required for any use of the Work.

  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
     party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
     CC0 or use of the Work.
