The WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit UI is a desktop application designed to help WebLogic users move their applications to run in a Kubernetes environment.

### Setting up your development environment
1. Download and install the latest LTS version of `node.js` from [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. If you rely on a proxy server to reach the Internet, set these five environment variables to configure the proxy correctly:
   ```
   ELECTRON_GET_USE_PROXY=true
   GLOBAL_AGENT_HTTPS_PROXY=<proxy-url>
   WKTUI_DEV_PROXY=<proxy-url>
   HTTPS_PROXY=<proxy-url>
   NO_PROXY=<list-of-no-proxy-hosts>
   ```
3. Open a command line and run the following command to update the version of `npm` to the latest:
   ```bash
   sudo npm install --global npm
   ```
4. Set up your global git configuration by running the following commands:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "<your real name>"
   git config --global user.email "<your-oracle-email-address>"
   git config --global core.ignoreCase false
   ```
   **This last command is critical if you are developing on either Windows or macOS.  Yes, the macOS file system
   is, by default, case-insensitive!**

5. Clone the git repository on GitHub at [https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-toolkit-ui](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-toolkit-ui).
6. Open a command line in the `weblogic-toolkit-ui` directory and run `npm install` to download and install the JavaScript dependencies required by the project.
7. Open a command line in the `weblogic-toolkit-ui/electron` directory and run `npm run install-tools`.
8. Open a command line in the `weblogic-toolkit-ui/webui` directory and run `npm start`.
9. After the server from the previous step is fully running, open a command line in the `weblogic-toolkit-ui/electron` directory and run `npm start`.

### Building a Windows or macOS installer
0. Set up your development environment and verify that the application is working properly from it.
1. Open a command line in the `weblogic-toolkit-ui/electron` directory and run `npm run build`.
2. Find the executable and installer(s) in the `weblogic-toolkit-ui/dist` directory.

### Building a Linux installer
0. Set up your development environment and verify that the application is working properly from it.
1. Open a command line in the `weblogic-toolkit-ui/webui` directory and run `npm run build:release`.
2. From the command line in the `weblogic-toolkit-ui/scripts` directory, run `./devBuildLinuxInstallers.sh`.
3. Find the executable and installer(s) in the `weblogic-toolkit-ui/dist` directory.
