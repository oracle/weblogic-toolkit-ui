The Quick Start tutorial employs a simple ToDo List application that uses a MySQL database running in a container to 
maintain its state. To get the application and supporting files, use one of the following methods:

- Download the [`quickstart.zip`](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-toolkit-ui/releases/latest/downloads/quickstart.zip) 
  or [`quickstart.tar.gz`](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-toolkit-ui/releases/latest/downloads/quickstart.tar.gz) file
  from the latest WKT UI 2.x.y release on [GitHub](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-toolkit-ui/releases/latest/).

- Clone the [WKT UI GitHub repository](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-toolkit-ui) and refer to the `samples/quickstart` subdirectory.
