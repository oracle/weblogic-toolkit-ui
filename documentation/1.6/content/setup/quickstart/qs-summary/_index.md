By following the steps in this Quick Start guide, you:
- Configured WKTUI and set up a new project.
- Manually created and edited a WDT model of a WebLogic domain using the Design View for visual editing of the model
and the Code View for viewing and editing model-related files.
- Pulled a prebuilt (primary) image from the Oracle Container Registry and then manually created an auxiliary image.
- Deployed a MySQL database.
- Depending on the track you followed:
  - Installed the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator to deploy your domain, then installed and configured an ingress controller to expose the sample application and provide its access in a browser window.
  - Otherwise, installed Verrazzano to define and deploy the sample application, and also employed an ingress controller to access the application in a browser window.
- Optionally, used the instructions in the Advanced section to discover the domain model offline or online remotely.

In summary, you used comprehensive WKTUI functionality to take an on-premises, sample WebLogic domain and deploy it in Kubernetes.
