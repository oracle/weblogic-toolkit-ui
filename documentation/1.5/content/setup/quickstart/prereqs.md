To work through the Quick Start guide, you will need to install the following software:

- Docker (or Podman) – If running on Windows or macOS, try Rancher Desktop, Docker Desktop, or even Podman Desktop.
- `kubectl` – The Kubernetes client (the version should align with the Kubernetes cluster version).
- Oracle Java JDK 11
- WebLogic Server 14.1.1
- Helm 3.9 or later – Only needed if following the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator track.
- Maven 3.6 or later – Only needed if rebuilding the sample application WAR file.
