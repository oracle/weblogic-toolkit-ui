The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator (WKO) manages the WebLogic or FMW domains for a set of namespaces in a Kubernetes cluster.
While it is possible to install multiple operators that manage disjoint sets of namespaces in a Kubernetes cluster, there is typically no need to do this.

To install the operator, go to the `Kubernetes` > `WebLogic Operator` page, verify the settings, and click **Install Operator**.  For these exercises, you'll use the default values, as shown in the following image, and then click **Install Operator**.

After the operator is installed successfully, you can move on to the next section.
