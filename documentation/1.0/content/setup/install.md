1. Download the latest WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit UI (WKT UI) application installers from the [Github Releases section](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-toolkit-ui/releases) of this repository.
1. Simply run the appropriate installer for your operating system.

Application startup detects Internet connectivity. If it fails to connect, a `Network Configuration` dialog appears that prompts you to set or modify your proxy settings, test your changes, and then restart the application.  

Initial launch of the application displays a thorough "Introduction" to the WKT UI. Step through it or dismiss it; you can peruse it at any time using `Help > Show Introduction`.
